                <h1>From the Dean</h1>
                <p>It is impossible to reflect upon 2020 without considering the impact of the novel coronavirus that changed our world. Even now, we’re not entirely sure how COVID-19 will impact us long-term. What we do know is that engineers solve problems and this one is no different.</p>
                <p>Like many, our engineers immediately responded to the
                    shortage of medical and personal protective equipment
                    by forming collaborations to design a do-it-yourself
                    ventilator from 3D-printed parts, to disinfect facemasks
                    for reuse, to create small-batch sanitizer and to create a
                    predictive data model to track the coronavirus spread,
                    allowing health systems to anticipate needed resources.</p>
                <p>Our Medicines for All Institute formed new public-private
                    partnerships this year to bring advanced manufacturing
                    of critically needed pharmaceuticals back to the United
                    States, producing drugs currently in short supply that
                    Americans need most, right here at home.</p>
                <p>At the same time, our faculty transitioned to remote
                    teaching while our students adapted to an all-remote
                    learning environment. Although COVID-19 changed the
                    way we did things, it didn’t slow us down.</p>
                <p>We are on track to open our 133,000-square-foot
                    Engineering Research Building in early 2021. Our faculty
                    continue making research advances that better humanity,
                    such as a cane that steers itself to guide those with visual
                    impairment and technologies for early detection of
                    Parkinson’s disease. Our students continue earning national
                    and international recognition, including selection to the
                    prestigious Lindau Nobel Laureate meeting, and our
                    biomedical engineering graduate program is among the
                    top-ranked.</p>
                <p>It’s been a year of progress for VCU Engineering as we’ve
                    advanced in research, in industry partnerships and in
                    unexpected ways. I hope it’s been a similar year for you.</p>

                    <p><a href="#">René Olivares-Navarrete, D.D.S., Ph.D.</a>, has received a $1.76 million grant from the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research at the National Institutes of Health to investigate how immune system cells control the body’s response to biomaterials. He is investigating the process by which macrophages and a type of protein they produce may orchestrate cells to respond to different kinds of implant surfaces, become pro-inflammatory or anti-inflammatory and recruit stem and immune cells.</p>

                    <p><a href="#">Daniel E. Conway, Ph.D.</a>, is studying the cellular- and tissue-level forces that maintain homeostasis in 3D epithelial structures. In one major study, he identified the importance of nuclear-cytoskeletal connections in regulating cellular contractility and maintaining tissue homeostasis. In a subsequent paper, he showed that osmotic gradients generate large mechanical forces in closed 3D tissue structures, and that these forces regulate fundamental cellular processes.</p>
                    <h2 class="mt-5">Groundbreaking eye-tracking technology</h2>
                    <p>Technology invented at VCU by a team led by <a href="#">Paul A. Wetzel, Ph.D.</a>, can assist a physician in diagnosing Parkinson’s disease and other conditions. In a quick, non-invasive diagnostic test, an eye tracker analyzes the eye’s natural movements. Wetzel and his collaborators won the university’s 2019 Billy R. Martin Award for Innovation for the invention.</p>

Lewinski is receiving about $333,000 over two years as part of a larger National Science Foundation grant to develop a line of similar coral cells and to investigate changes at the cellular level in coral biomineralization, symbiosis and wound healing. Her team is working toward developing materials that will arrange coral cells and polyps into integrated networks.</p>

                <p><img src="imgs/49655023116_bee3d6021f_o.jpg"></p>
                <p>To prevent domestic shortages of critical medications, the Medicines for All Institute (M4ALL), based at VCU Engineering, has joined forces with pharmaceutical industry leaders to bring manufacturing of vulnerable pharmaceuticals and their ingredients back to the United States.</p>
                <p>Phlow Corp., a Richmond-based public benefit corporation focused on the research, development and manufacturing of essential pharmaceuticals, leads the partnership and will incorporate M4ALL’s advanced manufacturing technologies to produce active pharmaceutical ingredients for critical and short-supply medications. Civica Rx, a leading nonprofit pharmaceutical company and national supplier of affordable, generic medications and AMPAC Fine Chemicals, with its Virginia-based pharmaceutical ingredient manufacturing operation, complete this new end-to-end pharmaceutical supply chain consortium to help reduce U.S. dependence on overseas drug manufacturers.</p>
                <blockquote class="float-right">“Not only are we bringing significant benefit to society, but we are also driving sustainable economic development by providing a highly skilled workforce for the future.”<cite><strong>— Barbara D. Boyan, Ph.D.</strong><br>NAE, NAI, FAIMBE, FAAS, FASBMR<br>Alice T. and William H. Goodwin, Jr. Dean VCU College of Engineering</cite></blockquote>
                <p>The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services announced a four-year contract with Phlow Corp. for $354 million to accelerate this initiative. The total contract value awarded to Phlow is up to $812 million which includes a four-year base award of $354 million with an additional $458 million included as potential options for long-term sustainability. Phlow Corp. was co-founded by M4ALL CEO B. Frank Gupton, Ph.D., and Eric Edwards, M.D., Ph.D., both VCU alumni.</p>
                <p>“The timeliness of this partnership cannot be overstated,” said VCU Engineering Dean Barbara D. Boyan, Ph.D. “The ability to provide critical generic pharmaceuticals for the treatment of COVID-19 now and in the post-pandemic world that are manufactured in the United States is invaluable for ensuring the health care of Americans. We look forward to sharing the resources of the Medicines for All Institute with Phlow, Civica and AMPAC to meet these challenges.”</p>
                <p>“The creation of the Medicines for All Institute and its evolution into this larger network of activity is a perfect example of the benefits possible by creating strong public-private partnerships,” Boyan said.</p>
                <blockquote class="float-left">“The COVID-19 event has made us acutely aware of our current vulnerability in this area. My colleagues and I are grateful for the opportunity to play a part in addressing this effort to fix the acute and chronic health care challenges that are facing us today by bringing pharmaceutical manufacturing back to the U.S.”<cite><strong>— B. Frank Gupton, Ph.D.</strong><br>Chief Executive Officer Medicines for All Institute</cite></blockquote>
                <p>M4ALL was founded out of VCU Engineering in 2017 to expand access to safe, effective and affordable medications. To do this, the institute’s engineers use advanced manufacturing technologies that significantly curb waste, cut costs and reduce pollution.</p>
                <p>M4ALL is a pioneer in the development of continuous flow processing, a method of producing active pharmaceutical ingredients uninterrupted. This eliminates the inefficient stops and starts of manufacturing these ingredients batch by batch, as they are commonly produced. Active pharmaceutical ingredients manufactured through continuous flow processing generate less waste and their quality tends to be higher and more consistent.</p>
                <p>Gupton said since its inception the institute has actively trained engineers and scientists in low-income countries, especially in Africa, and implemented its processes there. Gupton sees including domestic drug manufacturers in the institute’s network as an important next step. “The Medicines for All Institute is a global initiative that focuses on increasing access to health care for those who need it most. This new U.S.-driven effort will allow us to focus on creating a more robust and sustainable supply chain of essential medications in our country,” Gupton said.</p>
