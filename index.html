                <p>It is impossible to reflect upon 2020 without considering the impact of the novel coronavirus that changed our world. Even now, we're not entirely sure how COVID-19 will impact us long-term. What we do know is that engineers solve problems and this one is no different.</p>
                <p>Like many, our engineers immediately responded to the shortage of medical and personal protective equipment by forming collaborations to design a do-it-yourself ventilator from JD-printed parts, to disinfect facemasks for reuse, to create small-batch sanitizer and to create a predictive data model to track the coronavirus spread, allowing health systems to anticipate needed resources.</p>
                <p>Our Medicines for All Institute formed new public-private partnerships this year to bring advanced manufacturing of critically needed pharmaceuticals back to the United States, producing drugs currently in short supply that Americans need most, right here at home. </p>
                <p>At the same time, our faculty transitioned to remote teaching while our students adapted to an all-remote learning environment. Although COVID-19 changed the way we did things, it didn't slow us down. </p>
                <p>We are on track to open our 133,000-square-foot Engineering Research Building in late 2020. Our faculty continue making research advances that better humanity, such as a cane that steers itself to guide those with visual impairment and technologies for early detection of Parkinson's disease. Our students continue earning national and international recognition, including selection to the prestigious Lindau Nobel Laureate meeting, and our biomedical engineering graduate program is among the top-ranked. </p>
                <p>It's been a year of progress for VCU Engineering as we've advanced in research, in industry partnerships and in unexpected ways. I hope it's been a similar year for you. </p>

                    <p>The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services announced a four-year contract with Phlow Corp. for $354 million to accelerate this initiative. The total contract value awarded to Phlow is up to $812 million which includes a four-year base award of $354 million with an additional $458 million included as potential options for long-term sustainability. Phlow Corp. was co-founded by M4ALL CEO B. Frank Gupton, Ph.D., and Eric Edwards, M.D., Ph.D., both VCU alumni.</p>
                    <p>“The timeliness of this partnership cannot be overstated,” said VCU Engineering Dean Barbara D. Boyan, Ph.D. “The ability to provide critical generic pharmaceuticals – for the treatment of COVID-19 now and in the post-pandemic world – that are manufactured in the United States is invaluable for ensuring the health care of Americans. We look forward to sharing the resources of the Medicines for All Institute with Phlow, Civica and AMPAC to meet these challenges.”</p>

                    <p>M4ALL was founded within VCU Engineering in 2017 to expand access to safe, effective and affordable medications. To do this, the institute’s engineers use advanced manufacturing technologies that significantly curb waste, cut costs and reduce pollution.</p>
                    <p>M4ALL is a pioneer in the development of continuous flow processing, a method of producing active pharmaceutical ingredients uninterrupted. This eliminates the inefficient stops and starts of manufacturing these ingredients batch by batch, as they are commonly produced. Active pharmaceutical ingredients manufactured through continuous flow processing generate less waste and their quality tends to be higher and more consistent.</p>
                    <p>Gupton said since its inception the institute has actively trained engineers and scientists in low-income countries, especially in Africa, and implemented its processes there.</p>
                    <p>Gupton sees including domestic drug manufacturers in the institute’s network as an important next step.</p>
                    <p>“The Medicines for All Institute is a global initiative that focuses on increasing access to health care for those who need it most. This new U.S.-driven effort will allow us to focus on creating a more robust and sustainable supply chain of essential medications in our country,” Gupton said.</p>

While other approved methods of mask decontamination — such as using alcohol or steam — can work, they can also compromise the integrity of the masks after one or two uses. VCU’s process makes the masks reusable multiple times. Additionally, the process can be easily implemented by other institutions.</p>

                <p>Diving into real-world research isn’t just for upper-level students. VCU Engineering was the first in Virginia — and one of 24 universities nationwide — to join the prestigious Vertically Integrated Projects (VIP) Consortium. <a href="https://vip.vcu.edu">VIP@VCU</a> gives undergraduate students opportunities to work with graduate students and faculty on innovative, large-scale research projects.</p>
                <p>Over the course of sevearl years, students get to see results from their efforts: some develop new apps and inventions. One group of biomedical and mechanical and nuclear engineering students has designed a device aimed at preventing the life threatening condition of collapsed lung. The team has recently filed a patent application for its device and is currently testing prototypes.</p>
                <h2 class="mt-5">Dean’s Undergraduate Research Initiative</h2>
                <p>VCU Engineering undergraduates don’t have to wait to be on the forefront of discovery. Sophomores and juniors are eligible for research fellowships through the <a href="https://egr.vcu.edu/duri/">Dean’s Undergraduate Research Initiative (DURI)</a>. These students work with faculty, graduate student and postdoctoral mentors to design and execute an original, yearlong research project. These mentors also gain managerial and coaching skills.
                </p>
                <p>DURI fellows work to develop new knowledge that makes a difference in people’s lives. A 2019-20 DURI fellow in biomedical engineering investigated how varying the architecture and surface characteristics of 3D-printed bone and dental implants affects basic cellular signaling mechanisms that promote bone formation. The results will help optimize biomaterial design and improve implant integration. </p>

                </p>
                <p>This year, one DERI fellow used a non-invasive, patient-specific technique to demonstrate that stiffness of the abdominal aorta, associated with hypertension, generally increases with age, with a sharp increase around age 60. The project received a first place award from the American Society for Nondestructive Testing.
                </p>
                <p>Of the 23 DERI fellows in the 2019-20 cohort, 14 applied — and were accepted – to VCU Engineering. </p>

                <p>A multidisciplinary team of VCU faculty members is turning to hip-hop as an effective — and more importantly, fun — way to teach basic computer science concepts. In a project called Code Beats, students of <a href="#">David C.

                <p>From strengthening ties with a local elementary school to leading innovative learning approaches for middle school students, VCU Engineering continues to lay the groundwork for interest in STEM among the K-12 set.</p>
                <p>Thanks to VCU’s Engineering in Vision program and a new computer lab, students at John B. Cary Elementary School in the city of Richmond harnessed distance learning to see the world of engineering and virtually visit labs at the college. For her efforts, <a href="#">Jenilee Stanley-Shanks</a>, director of government and community outreach, was honored in 2019 as the elementary school’s volunteer of the year.</p>
                <p>Before the COVID-19 pandemic shuttered schools, VCU Engineering sent dozens of student, faculty and staff volunteers throughout the greater Richmond area to 16 events, reaching more than 3,000 students.</p>
                <p>Even after additional in-person Innovation Days and other programs were canceled, VCU Engineering provided free resources to the community. The office created and distributed an Early Engineers-at-Home Handbook for children in grades K-8 and a book of paper airplane designs.</p>
                <p>Next up? A new mentorship program for local middle school students.</p>

                    <p>C. Kenneth Wright, longtime benefactor of VCU College of Engineering, passed away in August 2019. He established the Wright Engineering Access Scholarship, VCU Engineering’s flagship scholarship program, in 2017 with a historic $5 million gift.</p>
                    <p>
                        A self-made man, Wright was devoted to helping determined young people make their lives all they could be. He was especially passionate about creating opportunities for military veterans, returning students, community college transfer students, first-generation and immigrant students — the so-called nontraditional students whose numbers are large at VCU Engineering.</p>
                    <p>
                        To date, Wright’s gift has funded 108 scholarships to engineering students. Some graduates are even perpetuating their benefactor’s legacy with their own gifts to the college. </p>
